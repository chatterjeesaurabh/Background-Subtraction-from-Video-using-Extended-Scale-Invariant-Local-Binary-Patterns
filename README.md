# DIP-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
This Repository contains the capstone project done as a part of my course in Digital Image Processing at IIT Kharagpur.
In this project, I along with my classmates Aniket Aitawade and Sandeep Kumar implemented an IET paper named Extended Scale Invariant Local Binary Pattern for Background Subtraction. The link to the paper is given below:
